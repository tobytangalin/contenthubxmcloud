When you deploy an XM Cloud environment, it automatically includes the Sitecore Connect for Content Hub connectors that allow you to connect to the Sitecore Content Management Platform (CMP) or Digital Asset Manager (DAM). Before you can use the CMP and DAM functionality, you have to enable the connectors on your platform. You can enable the connectors on an environment deployed to XM Cloud or for a local XM Cloud development environment based on Docker containers . The connectors are independent, and you can choose to enable both or just one of them.

"body" : "How to configure Sitecore items for import from Sitecore Content Hub. In order to import content from Sitecore Content Hub, you must create and configure a number of items in Sitecore. This walkthrough describes how to create the following mandatory items: Bucket - specify where to store imported content. Template - define the structure of imported content items. Entity mapping and Field mapping - determine how imported content is imported and where it is stored. The walkthrough also describes how to create the following optional items that control how relation content from Content Hub is processed: Relation field mapping - map relation content to Sitecore fields. Tag field mapping - map relation content to Sitecore tags. Related entity mapping - link different Content Hub asset types in Sitecore. Create a bucket All the imported content is stored in Sitecore buckets. For example, all blog posts are stored in a bucket called Blogs . To create a bucket: Right-click the CMP folder, click Insert , and click Bucket . The right-click menu on the CMP folder, showing the option to insert a bucket item Name the bucket, for example, Article , and click OK . Create a template The structure of the imported content is defined by the Sitecore templates. You must make sure that each template inherits the Content Hub Entity template. This template contains the EntityIdentifier field. To create a template: Navigate to a CMP folder, for example, templates\\User Defined\\CMP Connect . Create a template and name it, for example, Blog . Add all the necessary fields. For example, for a blog post, add a Title Single-Line Text field and a Body Multi-Line Text field. The Builder tab on a CMP template item On the Content tab, in the Data section, in the Base template field, click Content Hub Entity and then click the right arrow to add it to the Selected list. The Data section on the Content tab showing how to select base templates On the menu bar, on the View tab, select Standard Fields and Buckets . On the menu bar, on the Builder Options tab, select Standard Values . On the Content tab, in the Item Buckets section, select Bucketable . Save the item. Create an entity mapping Entity Mapping items and Field Mapping items define how content is imported and in what bucket it is stored. To create an entity mapping item: Navigate to \/sitecore\/system\/Modules\/CMP , right-click Config , click Insert , and click Entity Mapping . Enter the name for the new item, for example Article . By default, every entity mapping comes with a default field mapper for the display name. Under the Article entity mapping, select \/__Display name . On the Content tab, in the CMP Field Name field, enter a valid Property field name from the entity type, or schema, in Sitecore Content Hub. Sitecore uses this name as the display name. Save the item. In the content tree, navigate to the Article entity mapping. The Data section on the Content tab for the Article entity mapping On the Content tab, in the Data section, fill in the following fields: Field Content Entity Type Schema Enter the entity type used in Sitecore Content Hub Bucket Enter the item bucket to keep Sitecore items created from M-Entities of a given content type ID Template Enter a template to be used to create the Sitecore items. The template must contain the fields that are used to store the imported content Item Name Property Enter a valid Property field value of the entity type as Sitecore item name Save the item. Create a field mapping To map imported content to the Sitecore item structure, you must add Field Mapping items to each Entity Mapping item. You must create a Field Mapping item for each field that you want to import. To create a Field Mapping item: Right-click the Entity Mapping item that you created earlier, click Insert , and then click Field Mapping . Enter a name, for example, Title , and click OK . On the Content tab, in the Data section, fill in the following fields: Field Content CMP Field Name The name of the field in the Sitecore Content Hub Sitecore Field Name The field name as defined in the template you are using The Data section on the Content tab for a Field Mapping item showing the CMP FIeld Name and Sitecore Field Name fields You can add as many Field Mapping items as you require. To verify the entity type and structure in the Sitecore Content Hub: Create a new item in the Sitecore Content Hub or edit an existing one, for example, a blog post. Copy the URL, for example, https:\/\/yourdomain\/en-us\/content\/detail\/9782 , and paste it in a new browser tab. In the example URLs, replace 9782 with the ID of the entity item you have selected. Change the URL to https:\/\/yourdomain\/api\/entities\/9782 and press Enter . The entity structure is now shown in JSON. To find the entity’s content type, find the ContentTypeToContent relation and follow the link ( \"href\": \"https:\/\/yourdomain\/api\/entities\/9782\" ). The ContentType ToContent node in the entity structure JSON Now the content type is shown, in this example M.ContentType.Blog . The content type in the entity structure JSON Create a relation field mapping You can add relation field mappings which let you map the taxonomy fields from any content in Sitecore Content Hub to a Sitecore field. If the content belongs to multiple taxonomy values, the mapping separates the values using the configured delimiter . To create a relation field mapping item: Right-click the Entity Mapping item that you created earlier, click Insert , and then click Relation Field Mapping . Enter a name, for example, Audiences , and click OK . In the Data section, fill out the following fields: Field Content CMP Relation The relation name of the Sitecore Content Hub entity. CMP Field Name The name of the property in the Sitecore Content Hub relation entity. Sitecore Field Name The name of the content field where Sitecore stores the taxonomy values, as defined in the template you are using. The Data section should look, for example, like this: Data section for a relation field mapping Create a tag field mapping Tag field mapping lets you map the taxonomy fields from any content in Content Hub to the tag repositories in Sitecore. If the content belongs to multiple taxonomy values, the mapping separates the values using the configured delimiter . To create a tag field mapping: Right-click the Entity Mapping item that you created earlier, click Insert , and then click Tag Field Mapping . Enter a name, for example, Tag Taxonomy . Click OK . In the Data section, fill out the following fields: Field Content CMP Relation The relation name of the Sitecore Content Hub entity. CMP Field Name The name of the property in the Sitecore Content Hub relation entity. Enable \/ Disable to store Non-Leaf Node Choose one of the following: Enable Non-Leaf Node (Default) Disable Non-Leaf Node Store Tag Name Option As Choose one of the following: Full Path Name (Default) Node Name Custom Taxonomy Provider Name The name of a Sitecore custom taxonomy provider. If you select a custom taxonomy provider, Sitecore stores the taxonomy in the custom provider instead of in the default taxonomy provider. Leave this field blank to use the default taxonomy provider. See Build a custom taxonomy provider Build a custom taxonomy provider in the Sitecore developer documentation for information on how to create custom taxonomy providers. The Data section should look, for example, like this: Data section for a tag field mapping For more information on how the tag field mapping settings work, refer to the Sitecore developer documentation Sitecore developer documentation .
