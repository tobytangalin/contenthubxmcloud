When you deploy an XM Cloud environment, it automatically includes the Sitecore Connect for Content Hub connectors that allow you to connect to the Sitecore Content Management Platform (CMP) or Digital Asset Manager (DAM). Before you can use the CMP and DAM functionality, you have to enable the connectors on your platform. You can enable the connectors on an environment deployed to XM Cloud or for a local XM Cloud development environment based on Docker containers . The connectors are independent, and you can choose to enable both or just one of them. This section describes how to enable: CMP in a deployed XM Cloud environment DAM in a deployed XM Cloud environment CMP in a local XM Cloud development environment DAM in a local XM Cloud development environment " },
